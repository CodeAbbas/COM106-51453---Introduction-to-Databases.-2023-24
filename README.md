# COM106: Introduction to Databases (2023-24)

This repository contains the academic coursework, laboratory exercises, and lecture materials for the **COM106** module at **Ulster University London (QA Higher Education)**. The module provides a comprehensive introduction to relational database systems, SQL, and database management principles.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections: theory-based lecture materials and practical laboratory implementations.

### 📖 Lecture Materials

The lecture notes cover the fundamental lifecycle of database design, from investigation to security and physical storage:

* **Database Design:** Relational Model (RM), Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, and mapping ER diagrams to relational schemas.
* **Normalization:** Step-by-step guides for transforming data into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to eliminate redundancy and update anomalies.
* **SQL Fundamentals:** Structured Query Language (SQL) basics including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
* **Advanced SQL:** Complex queries involving single and multiple tables, joins, and nested subqueries.
* **Programmability:** Detailed implementations of **Stored Procedures** and **Triggers** in SQL Server.
* **Database Management:** Security (GDPR compliance), Transaction Management (ACID properties), and Physical Storage Structures (B-Trees and Hashing).

### 🧪 Laboratory Worksheets

The `Labs/` directory contains practical SQL implementation exercises using the **projemp** database:

* **Worksheets 1-4:** Relational table creation, population, and complex data retrieval (Joins/Grouping).
* **Worksheets 5:** Implementation of system-level logic using Stored Procedures and Triggers.
* **Worksheets 6-7:** Integrating databases with **Python** using Jupyter Notebooks and `pyodbc` for data analysis and visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **DBMS:** Microsoft SQL Server (Transact-SQL)
* **Tools:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Jupyter Notebooks
* **Languages:** SQL, Python (Pandas, pyodbc)

## 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Implemented

* **CRUD Operations:** Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting records.
* **Integrity Constraints:** Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Referential Integrity.
* **Relational Algebra:** Implementation of Joins (INNER, OUTER, SELF) and Set operations.
* **Database Objects:** Views for security and data abstraction.
